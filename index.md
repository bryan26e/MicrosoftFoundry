Welcome to the lab for *Develop your first agent with Microsoft Foundry*!

To complete this lab, you need an Azure subscription and a local installation of Visual Studio Code. Use the **setup guide** to ensure you have everything in place before you start.

> **No Azure Subscription?**<br>Microsoft Foundry is built on Microsoft Azure; so the exercises in this lab require an Azure subscription. If you don't have access to an Azure subscription, but you still want to explore key elements of agent development, you can check out the alternative ***Explore agent concepts*** lab; which uses apps with large language models that run locally in your browser - no Azure subscription required!

> **[Ask Anton](https://aka.ms/azk-anton){:target="_blank"}**<br/>![Anton avatar.](./Instructions/Labs/media/anton-icon.png)<br/>If you have questions about some of the topics covered in this lab, *[Ask Anton](https://aka.ms/choose-anton){:target="_blank"}* is a generative AI-based agent that you can ask about AI concepts and Microsoft Foundry. Choose the Azure-based or Browser-based version of the app at **[https://aka.ms/choose-anton](https://aka.ms/choose-anton){:target="_blank"}**. In the Azure-based version, use the **Configure** button to connect the agent to a deployed model in your Foundry project. The browser-based version runs a small language model in your browser, and may run slowly on older or low-spec computers.<br/><br/>*Ask Anton is not a supported Microsoft product or a component of Microsoft Learn or AI Skills Navigator. Just an experimental example of an AI agent for you to explore as you learn about what's possible with AI.*<br/><br/>If you *do* check out Ask Anton, we'd love you to *[tell us about your experience](https://forms.office.com/r/fC0ndfBQeK){:target="_blank"}*!
